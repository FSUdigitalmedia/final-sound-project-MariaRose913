## Notes
This sound was inspired by my favorite spot in high school. It was a place I would go when I was sad or angry and I would always leave with a clear and calm head. I wanted to capture the sadness at the beginning and develop the sound to a more relaxing and brighter tone by the end. Hope you enjoy it!
